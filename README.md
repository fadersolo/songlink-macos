# songlink-macos
Apple script to swap a song (or album) url from your clipboard and replace it with the universal song.link url

# How to install

Download [the script from here](https://github.com/fadersolo/songlink-macos/blob/main/Song.Link.scpt) and place in ~/Library/Scripts. I use it from the Script Menu in the Menubar.

# Examples

For example, here’s an Apple Music link for a song I recorded by the California Honeydrops:

https://music.apple.com/us/album/get-real-high/1669342098?i=1669342099

To share this with my pals that don’t use Apple Music, I copy this URL to my clipboard, then run the script and now my clipboard has this URL:

https://song.link/us/i/1669342099

And that can be shared with anybody, regardless of streaming service.
